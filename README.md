V 0.0 Initial commit to Github. Contains index.html, style.css and script.js.

V 0.1 Layout begun.  Basic CSS groundwork laid.  Inputs created.

V 0.1.1 Modified layout.  Pretty sick so I'm going to work on it later when I feel better.

V 0.2 Got basic book layout set in grid form of library.  Set variables for script.

V 0.3 Fine tuned placement of text and checkbox on sidebar.  Adjusted button size and text.  Successfully programmed library to add a book.  Programmed two icons on each book, one to change the book's read status and another to delete the book.  Next to add will be local/cloud storage to make the library fully usable.

# Library
